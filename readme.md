# Imageviewer

A simple image viewer I made throughout a week of win32/openGL API practice sessions.

**Features**

- minimal gui (just the image you want to see)
- mouse and keyboard navigation
- fullscreen,windowed and ontop modes
- drag and drop support
- playlists (scrub though files in directory, or files in drop-list if you dropped multiple)
